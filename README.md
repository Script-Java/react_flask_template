# Flask-React Template Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Flask-React Template Project! This project is a ready-to-use template designed to streamline the process of setting up a web application with Flask as the backend and React as the frontend. 

### Key Features:
- **Flask Backend**: Pre-configured with a database setup, authentication handling, and more.
- **React Frontend**: Integrated with TailwindCSS for easy and modern UI development, powered by Vite for fast development.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or modify the template to fit your project needs.

This template is designed to save you time by providing a solid foundation for your project, so you can focus on building features rather than setting up infrastructure.
